Defensive Line Havoc Rate Charts

The defensive line havoc rate charts were created to show how much havoc each team’s defensive line, in particular, was creating. Many havoc rates are offered either for defenses holistically or for front sevens, which include linebackers. The reason for this distinction was because Indiana, as it switched defensive philosophies during the coaching change in 2024, was making what was anticipated to be a major change in the amount of havoc it wanted its defensive line to create. This was a way to measure that. The chart used Pro Football Focus data in addition to cfbfastr data to identify players on each team’s defensive line and then calculate specific havoc instances (pressures, sacks, deflections, tackles for loss, etc.) created by those players in total. The chart was then sorted by the percentage of each team’s defensive havoc that was created by the defensive line. This created a chart that wasn’t necessarily intuitive, because total havoc instances don’t always equal the same percentage of havoc, but it did show various ideas, such as if a team’s defensive line had a high number of DL havoc instances but wasn’t representative of a large percentage of the defense’s havoc, then that defense created a ton of havoc overall.

This visualization’s data was calculated (using cfbfastr and Pro Football Focus) and organized in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The chart was produced using matplotlib. It was updated weekly.
