Advanced Stat Previews

Advanced Stat Previews were created to convey statistical profiles of each team on either side of the ball. The statistics are positioned in such a way that fans can see where, based on which team is on offense, they might see advantages between the opposing teams, whether that is passing, rushing, early downs, or a push from the offensive line. Also included were advanced analytics from sources such as ESPN SP+, ESPN FPI, and Brian Fremeau’s FEI ratings, and all of those stats are credited within the visualizations. The colors (green or purple) indicate whether a team’s ranking in the corresponding stat is within a certain tier of FBS teams, offering an easy method to evaluate the chart for those who either don’t understand the stats or can’t necessarily differentiate the rankings quickly.

This visualization’s data was calculated (using cfbfastr) and organized in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. Then, since other data sources were involved, the data was manually entered into a Google Sheet with conditional formatting for the color changes. A screenshot was taken of each finished sheet.
