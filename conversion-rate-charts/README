Conversion Rate Charts

The conversion rate charts were created to show how each new series of downs ends for each team, whether that be a touchdown, a first down, a punt, a field goal attempt, or a turnover. The end result is a percentage of series for each outcome, and the list of teams is ranked by conversion rate, which is the percentage of series that end in a positive outcome (touchdown, first down, field goal attempt). The bars are color coded by outcome with the positive outcomes being shades of green and negative outcomes being shades of purple. 

This visualizationâ€™s data was calculated (using cfbfastr) and organized in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The chart was produced using matplotlib. It was updated weekly.
